# PORTS: web 5199, devtools 9359. They must NOT collide with the sibling repos in this series
# (gridlock and the original pocket-cube copy defaulted to :5180/:9340, the batch runs
# :5185-:5197 / :9345-:9357) — a collision is not a nuisance, it is a false verdict, because
# the driver would attach to somebody else's Chrome and read a page that is not this game.
#
# Do NOT add --use-gl=angle --use-angle=swiftshader --enable-unsafe-swiftshader: software
# rasterisation saturates the cores and, with no CDP client attached, the process will not exit
# on its own. This game is a projected 3×3 of stickers on a 2D canvas, so plain headless Chrome
# is enough — one instance, ever: the browser suites share the single tab this script opens and
# run one at a time in order.
